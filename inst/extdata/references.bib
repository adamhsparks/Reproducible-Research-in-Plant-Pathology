  abstract = { Citrus canker is caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri and is one of the most devastating diseases on citrus plants. To investigate the virulence mechanism of this pathogen, a mutant library of strain 306 containing approximately 22,000 mutants was screened for virulence-deficient mutants in grapefruit (Citrus paradise). Eighty-two genes were identified that contribute to citrus canker symptom development caused by X. citri subsp. citri. Among the 82 identified genes, 23 genes were classified as essential genes, as mutation of these genes caused severe reduction of bacterial growth in M9 medium. The remaining 59 genes were classified as putative virulence-related genes that include 32 previously reported virulence-related genes and 27 novel genes. The 32 known virulence-related genes include genes that are involved in the type III secretion system (T3SS) and T3SS effectors, the quorum-sensing system, extracellular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide synthesis, and general metabolic pathways. The contribution to pathogenesis by nine genes (pthA4, trpG, trpC, purD, hrpM, peh-1, XAC1230, XAC1548, and XAC3049) was confirmed by complementation assays. We further validated the mutated genes and their phenotypes by analyzing the EZ-Tn5 insertion copy number using Southern blot analysis. In conclusion, we have significantly advanced our understanding of the putative genetic determinants of the virulence mechanism of X. citri subsp. citri by identifying 59 putative virulence-related genes, including 27 novel genes. },

  abstractnote = {&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Summary.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Young grapevine plants with decline and wood necrosis symptoms were collected from vineyards and nurseries in the Apulia and Molise regions, Italy, from 2013 to 2015. Isolations of fungi were prepared from 45 diseased grapevine plants, and the cultures were identified. Several species commonly associated with Petri disease, Botryosphaeria dieback, and black foot disease were isolated. A detailed study was carried out, and 182 isolates resembling &lt;em&gt;Cylindrocarpon&lt;/em&gt;-like asexual forms were identified through morphological characterisation and DNA analysis of internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 of the rRNA gene and the partial β-tubulin gene. &lt;em&gt;Dactylonectria torrensensis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ilyonectria liriodendri&lt;/em&gt; were identified based on morphological features and the partial histone 3 gene, so these fungi can be defined as the causal agents of black foot on grapevine for the first time in Italy. &lt;em&gt;Thelonectria blackeriella&lt;/em&gt; is also described as a new species, through morphological characterisation and multigenic analysis using sequence data for five loci (large subunit RNA, internal transcribed spacers, β-tubulin, actin, RNA polymerase II subunit 1). This new species was associated with black foot symptoms according to preliminary pathogenicity tests, with representative isolates of each of the three species. Pathogenicity tests showed that these species can cause black streaking in the wood of 1-year-old grapevine rootstock shoots. The identification of &lt;em&gt;D. torresensis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I. liriodendri&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T. blackeriella&lt;/em&gt; from young grapevine plants and rooted rootstock highlights the importance of black foot disease in Italy, which has previously been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&#38;gt;},

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;Species distribution models may provide realistic scenarios to explain the influence of bioclimatic variables in the context of emerging plant pathogens. &lt;em&gt;Xylella fastidiosa &lt;/em&gt;is a xylem-limited Gram-negative bacterium causing severe diseases in many plant species. We developed a maximum entropy model for &lt;em&gt;X. fastidiosa &lt;/em&gt;in Italy. Our objectives were to carry out a preliminary analysis of the species’ potential geographical distribution and determine which eco-geographical variables may favour its presence in other Italian regions besides Apulia. The analysis of single variable contribution showed that precipitation of the driest (40.3%) and wettest (30.4%) months were the main factors influencing model performance. Altitude, precipitation of warmest quarter, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and land cover provided a total contribution of 19.5%. Based on the model predictions, &lt;em&gt;X. fastidiosa&lt;/em&gt; has a high probability (&amp;gt; 0.8) of colonizing areas characterized by: i) low altitude (0–150 m a.s.l.); ii) precipitations in the driest month &amp;lt; 10 mm, in the wettest month ranging between 80–110 mm and during the warmest quarter &amp;lt; 60 mm; iii) mean temperature of coldest quarter ≥ 8°C; iv) agricultural areas comprising intensive agriculture, complex cultivation patterns, olive groves, annual crops associated with permanent crops, orchards and vineyards; forest (essentially oak woodland); and Mediterranean shrubland. Species distribution models showed a high probability of &lt;em&gt;X. fastidiosa&lt;/em&gt; occurrence in the regions of Apulia, Calabria, Basilicata, Sicily, Sardinia and coastal areas of Campania, Lazio and south Tuscany. Maxent models achieved excellent levels of predictive performance according to area under curve (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS) and minimum difference between training and testing AUC data (AUC&lt;sub&gt;diff&lt;/sub&gt;). Our study indicated that &lt;em&gt;X. fastidiosa&lt;/em&gt; has the potential to overcome the current boundaries of distribution and affect areas of Italy outside Apulia.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

Growth chamber experiments using Petri dishes revealed that rhizobia infection on chickpea roots reduced broomrape seed germination, and restricted the broomrape attachment to host roots while retarding tubercle formation and development by the parasite. In pot experiments, chickpea roots inoculated with rhizobia reduced the total number of broomrape by up to 90%. Broomrape necrosis was observed both before and after parasite attachment to inoculated chickpea roots in Petri dishes and pot experiments. Reduction in infection was accompanied by enhanced levels of the defence-related enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POX). Increased levels of phenolics were recorded in the roots of rhizobia-inoculated plants grown in the presence of broomrape. The results suggest that rhizobia could be used for protection of chickpea against &lt;em&gt;O. foetida&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

  abstractnote = {Mycotoxins are becoming an increasingly important topic in both human and animal fields. With the improvement of analytical methods it is possible to identify a great number of known and unknown toxic metabolites. However, even for the most well studied mycotoxins, namely aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins and ochratoxin A, several questions remain unanswered. In which commodities are they most commonly found and at which levels? Which worldwide regions are more prone to mycotoxin occurrence and how severe is the contamination? In an attempt to answer these questions, a worldwide mycotoxin survey has been been carried out. A total of 6,058 feedstuffs and finished feed samples were analyzed between January 2009 and December 2010 for the presence of the aforementioned mycotoxins. 1,695 samples were analyzed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and 4,363 samples were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). This paper presents the results of these analyses from a geographical point of view (by world region) and by commodity type, separated by analytical method. The outcome is clear and mycotoxins are reported to be ubiquitously present as 24, 21, 65, 48 and 17% of analyzed samples tested positive for aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins and ochratoxin A, respectively in the case of ELISA-analyzed samples and 31, 44, 50, 56 and 27% of HPLC-analyzed samples tested positive for the same mycotoxins.},
